GoodOne marketplace.

## Frontend production environment

`client/.env.production` contains the public production app configuration:

```sh
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://good-one-api.onrender.com
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://good-one-api.onrender.com/api
REACT_APP_SUPPORT_EMAIL=goodone@swivelit.in
```

Replace `https://good-one-api.onrender.com` before production builds if the real Render backend URL is different. Do not put secrets in React environment files because they are bundled into the app.

## Render backend deployment

- Root directory: `Backend`
- Build command: `npm ci && npx prisma generate`
- Pre-deploy command: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Required environment variables include `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRE`, `CLIENT_URLS`, `EMAIL_USER`, and `EMAIL_PASS`.
- Set `CLIENT_URLS=https://good-one-jlcu.onrender.com,capacitor://localhost,ionic://localhost,http://localhost,https://localhost` for the Render backend. Also include the real final frontend domain if it is different.

## Capacitor mobile apps

Android already exists at `client/android` and Capacitor Android 7 requires JDK 21 for Gradle builds. If your terminal still uses Java 17, switch `JAVA_HOME` to a JDK 21 install before running Gradle. iOS is generated when needed and requires a Mac, an Apple Developer account, and Xcode 26 or newer. Before iOS sync/archive, make sure `xcode-select` points to the full Xcode app and the Xcode license has been accepted.

To generate and open iOS:

```sh
cd client
npx cap add ios
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

After `npx cap add ios`, add these permission descriptions to `client/ios/App/App/Info.plist`:

- `NSCameraUsageDescription`: `GoodOne needs camera access for vendor live photo verification.`
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`: `GoodOne needs photo library access so vendors can upload product images.`

## Mobile release checklist

Android:

```sh
cd client
npm ci
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

- In Android Studio, use `Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK`.
- Output should be an AAB for the Play Store.

iOS:

```sh
cd client
npx cap add ios
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

- In Xcode, use `Product > Archive > Distribute App`.

Store assets:

- App icon
- Splash screen
- Screenshots
- Privacy policy URL
- Support email
- Reviewer test login
- Data Safety
- App Privacy
- Content rating
